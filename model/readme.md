# Research Branch - Model Folder

This section contains the machine learning models used for the project. The following folders are included: 

- `CNN`: the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. 
- `FNN`: the Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model.
- `RCNN`: the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model. 
- `autogluon`: the code for training models using the AutoGluon library.
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploring and analyzing the models. 

Each folder contains the code for the respective model and additional resources for training, tuning, and evaluating the models. Use the notebooks for further analysis and experimentation.

#### Explaination of the model uesed

CNN: CNNs are a type of deep learning model designed to process image data. They use convolutional layers to extract and process information from the input data, and they can automatically detect features from the input data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.

FNN:FNNs are a type of deep learning model that consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. They process input data and generate output based on the weights and biases of the network's neurons.

RCNN: RCNNs are a type of deep learning model designed for object detection and localization. They use convolutional layers to process image data and generate regions of interest, and then use a separate set of layers to classify these regions and generate bounding boxes around the objects.

autogluon: AutoGluon is a library for automated machine learning that automates the tuning and training of machine learning models. It provides a high-level API for training models using a variety of algorithms, including deep learning models.
