# Research Branch
This branch contains all of the code and resources related to training machine learning models for the [wildfire-ai].

## Folders
The research branch consists of the following folders:

<b>analysis:</b> 
This folder contains code and resources for analyzing the performance of the machine learning models.

<b>doc:</b>
This folder should contain documentation and notes related to the machine learning models and their training process.
Right now we add just documenting of how we work as team, product development level and mildstones.

<b>model:</b> 
This folder contains the code for the different machine learning models.

<b>optimization/notebooks</b>: 
This folder contains notebooks and scripts used to optimize and fine-tune the machine learning models.

<b>utilities:</b> 
This folder contains helper functions and tools that are used by other parts of the research branch.

### Getting Started
To get started with the research branch, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
3. Open the notebooks in the optimization/notebooks folder and run the code to train and fine-tune the machine learning models.
4. Use the code in the model folder to save the trained models and use them in your application.
5. Use the code in the analysis folder to evaluate the performance of the models and gain insights into how to improve them.
