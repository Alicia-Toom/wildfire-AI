# Optimization Folder
This folder contains optimization notebooks for various computer vision tasks. The following notes are included in this folder:

## 1. Optimization for CNN Images Classification using Random Search
In this notebook, you will find the optimization of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using random search. The aim of this optimization is to find the best hyperparameters for the CNN model that maximizes the accuracy of the classification task.

## 2. Optuna for Object Detection
In this notebook, you will find an attempt to optimize an object detection model using the Optuna library. This optimization aims to find the best hyperparameters for the object detection model that maximizes its performance.

## 3. Ray for Object Detection
In this notebook, you will find an attempt to optimize an object detection model using the Ray library. Similar to the Optuna notebook, this optimization aims to find the best hyperparameters for the object detection model to improve its performance.

## Note
Unfortunately, the optimization using Optuna and Ray was not successful. However, the notebooks provide a starting point for future optimization attempts and may still be useful for reference.
