The <b>analysis</b> folder contains two sub-folders: notebooks and plots.

The <b>notebooks</b> sub-folder contains Jupyter notebooks that perform data analysis on your current dataset. These notebooks are used to understand and analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships. The notebooks provide a comprehensive view of the data and can be used to generate insights that can inform the training of your machine learning models.

The <b>plots</b> sub-folder contains visual representations of the data analysis performed in the notebooks. These plots are used to graphically display the findings and insights gained from the data analysis. They provide a visual representation of the data and can be used to communicate the findings to others. The plots are saved in a variety of formats and can be easily shared or embedded in reports or presentations.

Together, the notebooks and plots sub-folders provide a comprehensive view of the data and the insights gained from the data analysis. They are an important part of the machine learning model development process and provide valuable information to help inform the training of your models.
