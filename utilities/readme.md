 The <b>utilities</b> folder contains a collection of Python scripts that provide helper functions for data processing, image manipulation, and plotting. 

The contents of this folder are as follows:

data.py - This file contains functions related to data processing, i.e loading and preprocessing data.

image.py - This file contains functions related to image manipulation, i.e resizing, cropping, and normalizing images.

plot.py - This file contains functions for plotting data, i.e creating scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts.

This utilities folder is designed to make it easier for us to process, manipulate, and visualize data for your machine learning models.
The functions in this folder can be used to perform common tasks that are required for data analysis and model training. 
By providing these helper functions, the utilities folder helps to streamline our workflow and reduce the amount of repetitive code needed to write.
