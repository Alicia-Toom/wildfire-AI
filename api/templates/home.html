    <introduction>Wildfire ai is a api interface for detecting forest wildfires.
    The problem with wildfires is that they can spring up when you aren't looking.<br>
    This a concern for us, and our solution is to create this platform for feeding
    images and videos to our machine learning models.<br>
    These machine learning models will detect and monitor for any wildfire.
    If any are detected a intelligent system of alerts<br>
    can be setup on this platform to alert the wanted authority and concerned individuals.

        <h3>Our goal</h3>
        <p>Our goal is a platform that solve the problem for human monitoring of wildfires.
        We will do this by take developing a intelligent and<br>optimized system architecture
        both with machine learning fire detection and also with alerting.<br>
        We're also inteding to in the future to bring the features.
