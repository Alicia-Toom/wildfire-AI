#Wildfire AI

Introduction
The project aims to detect wildfires from users both in real-time and by uploading images to the website. The project uses one model for object detection and object localization and one model for image recognition. The models are trained on a dataset containing forest fires and non fire images. The goal of the project is to use drones and monitoring stations to identify areas affected by wildfires and alert relevant authorities.


Technical Details
The image recognition model is build using a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). It stands out for its ways to process pixel data, through convolutional layers before output the result. It can also automatically detect features from input data, which minimise the human effort.
We decided to go with a CNN for its straightforward usage and that it showed best results early in our exploring process.
